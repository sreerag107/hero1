            <p>The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be
                displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and
                scripting languages such as JavaScript.

                Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents
                into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
                included cues for the appearance of the document.

                HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such
                as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured
                documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes
                and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as and
                directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as surround and provide information about
                document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use
                them to interpret the content of the page.

                HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior
                and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web
                Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has
                encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997</p><br>
            <h1>History</h1>
            <hr><br>
            <p>In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for
                CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an
                Internet-based hypertext system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software
                in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a
                joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes[4]
                from 1990 he listed[5] "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used" and put an encyclopedia
                first.

                The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags", first mentioned on
                the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.[6][7] It describes 18 elements comprising the initial,
                relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by
                SGMLguid, an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN.
                Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.[8]

                HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other
                material into visual or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are
                defined in the browser, and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's
                additional use of CSS. Many of the text elements are found in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537
                Techniques for using SGML, which in turn covers the features of early text formatting languages such as
                that used by the RUNOFF command developed in the early 1960s for the CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing
                System) operating system: these formatting commands were derived from the commands used by typesetters
                to manually format documents. However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements
                (nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely print effects, with also the separation of
                structure and markup; HTML has been progressively moved in this direction with CSS.

                Berners-Lee considered HTML to be an application of SGML. It was formally defined as such by the
                Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) with the mid-1993 publication of the first proposal for an HTML
                specification, the "Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)" Internet Draft by Berners-Lee and Dan Connolly,
                which included an SGML Document type definition to define the grammar.[9][10] The draft expired after
                six months, but was notable for its acknowledgment of the NCSA Mosaic browser's custom tag for embedding
                in-line images, reflecting the IETF's philosophy of basing standards on successful prototypes.
                Similarly, Dave Raggett's competing Internet-Draft, "HTML+ (Hypertext Markup Format)", from late 1993,
                suggested standardizing already-implemented features like tables and fill-out forms.[11]

                After the HTML and HTML+ drafts expired in early 1994, the IETF created an HTML Working Group, which in
                1995 completed "HTML 2.0", the first HTML specification intended to be treated as a standard against
                which future implementations should be based.[12]

                Further development under the auspices of the IETF was stalled by competing interests. Since 1996, the
                HTML specifications have been maintained, with input from commercial software vendors, by the World Wide
                Web Consortium (W3C).[13] However, in 2000, HTML also became an international standard (ISO/IEC
                15445:2000). HTML 4.01 was published in late 1999, with further errata published through 2001. In 2004,
                development began on HTML5 in the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), which
                became a joint deliverable with the W3C in 2008, and completed and standardized on 28 October 2014</p>
